Automated Imaging, Undeletion, Recovery, Indexing, Organizing, Some Forensics, and Crypto Salvaging for any storage device Linux can recognize.

Given any hard drive, Tomb Raider will do everything in its power to recover as much data as possible on the drive, and do so entirely automatically. It was designed because I started wanting to do data recovery on any trashed hard drive I could find, and found myself repeating the same steps over and over for them, or skipping steps because I didn't want to spend the time constantly coming back to it and having to do yet another tedious step for one hard drive after another. I was finding hard drives faster than I could image them, and found myself spending all day doing this and obsessing over it - which wasn't 


 including searching through all partitions, all unallocated space, everything. It will then try to acquire the original structure of the data (the filesystem) and filenames, if the filesystem still is recoverable. Then, all OS files are filtered out so that only user files are left, these files are indexed and categorized, with anomalies or types of files laid out. Optionally, you can also search these files with a bitcoin salvager to test all private keys it finds.

For any drive, this will take at most twice as much hard drive space on your computer to attempt to recover as much as possible, e.g. if you have a 500GB drive you're recovering, and it's completely full of data, you may need up to 1000GB (1TB) of storage to fully run this program in it's current iteration. 

For any drive, this may take multiple days to run. The emphasis of this program is to make it fully automated, and as rigorous and meticulous as possible. No shortcuts, this bot puts first priority on recovering as much data as possible before filtering out any known irrelevant data (files that came with your OS, for example).
